## Design Decisions:

HTML5 Structure: Used semantic HTML5 tags for clear sectioning of the form (e.g., section, label, input). Each section (Personal Info, Income, Deductions, and Tax Calculation) is easy to navigate and also providing keyboard navigation.

TailwindCSS: Chose TailwindCSS to speed up styling while keeping the layout clean and responsive across devices. The structure of the form is kept simple and there is some color contrast for good readability.

JavaScript/jQuery: Used jQuery for easy DOM manipulation and event handling. Validation is done live as the user types, ensuring good user experience.
